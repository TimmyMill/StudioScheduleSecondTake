# StudioScheduleSecondTake
Mike Knutson , studioSchedule, 12.14.2015, not-functional.

This program was intended to allow a user to make use of a client database and a calander database to schedule sessions in
a make-believe studio. The GUI operates of a series of nested Jpanels, to which I use the cardLayout to create a number of different
panels and then switch between them as needed. The application ( when fully functional) should include three main feautes, the abliity 
to interact with a clients database (created by the progam), this gathers the information for the client, add assigns them a unique ID key.
The second is viewing the calender, and interacting with it to scedule sessions that would be stored into a appointments database. 
The final being a description of the different studios equipment.

I never got my calendar to display within the panel that I wanted, so there is no calendar and thus no database to associate with sceduled session, trying 
to get the cardLayout manager that I used to build the calendar proved to difficult. I got the calendar created by itself, but can't get the studioManager to recognize it.

nothing special should be needed to run my code, it should create the database and table that are being used.
I tried hard but there isn't a whole lot here that will impress...
